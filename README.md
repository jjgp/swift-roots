Roots is a pattern for organizing an application's state and logic in an unidirectional manner. In doing so, an
application follows a consistent mental model that yields benefits of being consistent, understandable, debuggable,
and testable. The core concepts are state, actions, reducers, and effects. These concepts are inspired from many
other popular frameworks: [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux),
[Redux-Observable](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable),
[ReSwift](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift),
[The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture), and etc.
